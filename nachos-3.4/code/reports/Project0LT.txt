Project 0 Report

a) Installation of NachOS was fairly straightforward thanks to previous experience uisng PuTTY, Ocelot, and WinSCP. All programs
were ran on my Windows PC running on Intel i9 with 64.0 GB of RAM. 

b) Experience with tests was also straight forward once again due to previous experience. Test ran correctly ./nachos looped 4 times and halted without error with 130 system ticks
halt functioned as intended immediately halting the system before exiting with single step shows several steps loops through system registers before calling the halt() system
call.

c) Threads are a series of process that can be executed concurrently with the Thread class containing routines to manage them.
according to the thread source code, there are four main operations: fork, finish, yield, and sleep.
